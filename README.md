# Frontend Mentor Challenge - IP Address Tracker

![Design preview for the IP Address Tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I used the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## Purpose

I completed this challenge to reinforce the following concepts:

- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Fetch API
- Responsive Design
- CSS Pseudo Selectors
- Promises
